# brainfuck_interpreter

A classic brainfuck interpreter written in python3.6

**brainfuck_interpreter** does'nt need any dependencies (except a python 3 interpreter)

To use it just type in your terminal : 

> ./brainfuck_interpreter file_to_read

You can add the size of the segment you want to allocate to your program in the second argument.

## Note

brainfuck test files doesn't belong to me, there are just copy paste from wikipedia
